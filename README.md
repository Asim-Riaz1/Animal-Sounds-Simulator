# 🐾 Animal Sound Simulator (C++ OOP - Polymorphism)

This is a simple and educational **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** project in **C++**, showcasing **polymorphism** and **abstract classes** using an animal sound simulation.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To demonstrate how polymorphism works in C++ using **virtual functions** and **dynamic dispatch**. Each animal subclass overrides the base class method to provide its own behavior.

---

## 👨‍🏫 Concepts Demonstrated

- **Abstract Class (`Animal`)** with a pure virtual function
- **Inheritance** from a common base class
- **Runtime Polymorphism** using base class pointers
- **Virtual Function Overriding**

---

## 🐕🐈🐄 Classes Overview

| Class  | Description                          |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `Animal` | Abstract base class with `makeSound()` |
| `Dog`   | Inherits `Animal`, says "Woof!"     |
| `Cat`   | Inherits `Animal`, says "Meow!"     |
| `Cow`   | Inherits `Animal`, says "Moo!"      |

---

## 🧪 Sample Output

```text
Woof!
Meow!
Moo!
Each output is generated by calling makeSound() through a base class pointer.

🛠️ How to Compile & Run

📚 Educational Value
This project is ideal for students learning:

Abstract classes and interfaces

Virtual functions and overriding

Dynamic binding and base class pointers

✅ Suggestions for Expansion
Add more animals like Sheep, Lion, etc.

Accept animal type as input and create objects dynamically

Implement a zoo simulation with a sound test loop
